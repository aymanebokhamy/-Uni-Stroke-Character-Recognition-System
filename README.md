# -Uni-Stroke-Character-Recognition-System
Java uni-stroke character recognition program that identifies numbers drawn on the canvas using a pattern recognition process.
The algorithm is the following:
•	Translate the array of points captured by the mouse events.
•	Scale the array of points
•	Normalize the array of points
•	Compare the array of points with a “standard” set of patterns – the base set – to find the pattern that best matches the normalized set of points.
